    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning...\n",
    "\n",
    "*Machine Learning* is a branch of computer science concerned with the application of algorithms and neural networks to improve computer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data drives the machine learning process. \"Training data\" applied to mathematical models summarizes trends to make decisions on \"test data\", or information that the model has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning was inspired by Donald Hebb's 1949 research on brain cell interaction. The concept \"fire together wire together\" referring to neural mechanisms of learning inspired the mathematics driving machine learning (like gradient descent) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the constraints of our course, we studied Machine Learning via the Python module 'scikit-learn':\n",
    "\n",
    "> Machine Learning in Python [18]\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis\n",
    "> - Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts\n",
    "> - Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib\n",
    "> - Open source, commercially usable - BSD license\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, skikit-learn will be used to demonstrate some examples of algorithmic bias in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### & its consequence: Algorithmic Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "*Algorithmic Bias* described systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create unfair outcomes [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern technology is an asset to the human experience, however sophisticated tools meant to simulate the process of decision making have proven too good for their use cases. Applying machine learning to datasets that inadvertently reflect outdated legislation, social injustice, or subconscious bias results in a model that will perpetuate those themes when put to production. Machine learning is a specialized science, and as a result society is often unaware of the technicalities that drive the decision making process, and so it can be difficult to think critically about machine impartiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture, we discussed common uses of machine learning and how they can reflect algorithmic bias when fed biased data [18]:\n",

    "It is obvious that the vast majority of the historical recipiants of Oscar awards have identified themselves as white and straight. This is an example of data that represents the reality of one very specific institution of the complex society that we live in: the Oscar Awards. Obtaining an Oscar is a very prestigious honor for actors/actresses and filmmakers, and is certainly a metric of success in their field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that you are the casting director for a new film that is to be produced by a major studio. You have the budget to hire the best of the best, so that is what you aim to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical model could be trained on this dataset to extract features that are correlated with a high success rate, determined by obtaining an Oscar. You could then apply this model to your pool of potential candiadates, and the algorithm would output candidates whose demographic information matches most closely with demographics of those who have won an oscar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the original dataset lacks demographic diversity, it will induce bias on the models output and recommend majority straight white candidates, discarding others since the data is skewed so strongly to this demographic.\n",

    "#### Managing Bias in Data\n",
    "Google researchers propose a method for [identifying and correcting bias in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04966v1.pdf). We will briefly explore the theory to better understand how bias occurs in data and one way that we can continue to harness the power of machine learning despite the inevidability of biased data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main idea: A biased dataset can be perceived by the classifier to be unbiased, yet manipulated by a biased agent. The biased data is then re-weighted to fit the theoretical unbiased data and only then is fed to a machine learning algorithm as training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: Existence of underlying unbiased labels that are overwritten by agent who intends to provide accurate labels but may have unconscious bias against certain groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results: Showed training on re-weighted data corresponds to training on underlying unbiased labels, resulting in an unbiased classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics to assess bias in algorithms:\n",
    "1. **Demographic parity**: Classifier should make positive predictions on a protected population group at the same rate as the entire population.\n",
    "2. **Disparate impact**: Same idea as demographic parity except classifier does not know which protected population groups exist and which data points relate to such protected groups.\n",
    "3. **Equal opportunity**: Classifier should have equal true positive rates on protected population group as those of the entire population.\n",
    "4. **Equalized odds**: Classifier should have both equal true positive and false positive rate on a protected population group as those of the entire population.\n",
    "Each metric exists as a positive number describing how close the algorithm is to \"full fairness\" (0)."

    "Machine learning can present politically-charged propoganda to third parties without their explicit knowledge or consent. This example of algorithmic bias occured in the 2016 US presidential election. Russia paid for political ads pushing specific views on polarized topics to appear on Facebook. This situation was controversial because the techniques used by the interveining party were often subtle and deceptive.\n",

This will give us a better idea of how ad spend might (or might not) influence outcomes. We'll also familiarize ourselves with the machine learning pipeline along the way."
